<p><strong>CORAL Licensing User Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>About CORAL Licensing</strong></p>
<p>A component of Hesburgh Libraries locally developed ERM, CORAL Licensing provides a way to store and access digital copies of current and expired license agreements and related documents as well as associated agreement metadata. The licensing module helps make library license agreements more accessible to personnel through select searchable metadata fields and assists institutions in tracking and using specific pieces of information included in legal agreements. CORAL Licensing is a flexible document management system, useful in anticipating a variety of agreements and institutional goals for managing agreements. The module allows users to identify license clauses most important to record and track from an institutional point of view. With related features like a clause comparison function, and ILL and course pack terms tools that can be implemented to deliver terms through other systems such as SFX, the CORAL Licensing module provides a way to make better use of permissions included in the license agreement.</p>
<p><em>Please note that screenshots and text in this document are just examples and do not necessarily reflect terms for a particular resource.</em></p>
<p><strong>Component Overview</strong></p>
<p>CORAL Licensing has six major components in the primary navigation at the top of each page.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Home</li>
<li>New License</li>
<li>Licenses in Progress</li>
<li>Expression Comparison</li>
<li>Terms Tool Report</li>
<li>Admin</li>
</ul>
<p># <strong>Home</strong></p>
<p>Search has been placed on the <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>Home <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>page as the primary point of entry into the license records. The search runs against the fields license name, document name, and publisher/provider. The fields are defined in the next section as we look at creating a new license record.</p>
<p># <strong>New License</strong></p>
<p>Select <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">*</span></a>New License <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>from the main navigation to begin adding new license records. The link will present the window on the right.</p>
<p>&#8216;License Name&#8217; is the name of the license record. For example, a license record named <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">*</span></a>Cambridge University Press Journals <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">*</span></a>would contain any and all license documents pertaining to the Cambridge University Press journals.</p>
<p>&#8216;Publisher/Provider&#8217; is the name of the licensing organization.  In this example Cambridge University Press would be the publisher/provider.</p>
<p>&#8216;Consortium&#8217; would be used when the licensed resources are obtained through a consortium.</p>
<p>The License Name may seem a bit arbitrary but it makes more sense when you think about a license record as a way to group together all licenses that are either related to each other or related to the same resource. Let us say for example that you have licensed a package of electronic journals from Springer and have over the years collected several licenses and amendments for that package. You can place all of those documents on the same license record and then you need to give the license record a name which gives some indication as to the documents found on that record. In this example &#8216;Springer Online Journals&#8217; may be a valid license name.</p>
<p>Let us also assume that you have licensed a set of eBooks from Springer as well and that the license for the eBook is in no way related to the license for the journals. You now have two options for loading the eBook license. You can create a new license record called <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">*</span></a>Springer eBooks <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">*</span></a>and load the license documents there or you can add the eBook license to the existing <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">*</span></a>Springer Online Journals <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">*</span></a>license. If you choose the latter then you could also consider changing the license name <a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">*</span></a>Springer Online Journals to <a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">*</span></a>something such as <a href="#id25"><span class="problematic" id="id26">*</span></a>Springer Online Products <a href="#id27"><span class="problematic" id="id28">*</span></a>to more accurately reflect all the documents contained on the record.</p>
<p><a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">*</span></a>Interoperability note: <a href="#id31"><span class="problematic" id="id32">*</span></a>The publisher/provider field has an auto-fill feature which is populated from the organizations listed in CORAL Organizations. CORAL Licensing will manage publisher/provider names on its own if you have not installed CORAL Organizations or have disabled the interoperability. The publisher/provider names are managed and edited in the CORAL Licensing <a href="#id33"><span class="problematic" id="id34">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id35"><span class="problematic" id="id36">*</span></a>area when the interoperability is disabled.</p>
<p>## <strong>Adding / Editing New License Record</strong></p>
<p>Here is a new license record which has just been created for <em>Cambridge University Press Online Journals</em>.  To the right of the license name are the options to remove the license or to edit the name, publisher/provider and consortia. The publisher/provider name is hyperlinked and will take the user to the Cambridge University Press record within CORAL Organizations. Here you can also enter a license record status in the &#8216;License Status&#8217; field to the far right of the license name. CORAL Licensing includes the following default statuses.</p>
<p>License Status (definition)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Awaiting Document (license record created but scanned license not yet added)</li>
<li>Complete (license record is complete, no additional work required)</li>
<li>Document Only (document loaded with expressions not identified or loaded)</li>
<li>Editing Expressions (document loaded and currently adding license terms/expressions)</li>
<li>NLR  (no license required)</li>
</ul>
<p>License Status values can be edited, added or deleted through the <a href="#id37"><span class="problematic" id="id38">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id39"><span class="problematic" id="id40">*</span></a>section detailed later in this document. The default values are simply suggestions for how an institution might consider tracking agreements and to indicate the purpose of the field.</p>
<p>The license record has four sections located on the left-hand column; Documents, Expressions, SFX Links and Attachments</p>
<p>## <strong>Documents</strong></p>
<p>The Documents tab contains all the documents for each license record. Any document may be uploaded to the system including licenses, amendments, order forms, purchase requests, or any other important document.  Select &#8216;upload new document&#8217; to begin.</p>
<p>## <strong>Adding New Documents</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;upload new document&#8217; link opens the window on the right.  Here you can fill out the initial details of the document and upload the actual file. Document Name is the only required field.</p>
<p>&#8216;Effective date&#8217; is the effective date of the agreement, if identified and available.</p>
<p>&#8216;Document Type&#8217; identifies what type of document this is (ex. Agreement, amendment, order form, etc).</p>
<p>&#8216;Parent&#8217; identifies any parent document (ex. A parent document would be assigned when uploading an amendment).</p>
<p>&#8216;Name&#8217; is the title of the document, usually taken directly from the license document (ex. Cambridge University Press Site License Agreement).</p>
<p>&#8216;File&#8217;- browse and upload a scanned copy of the actual document.</p>
<p>&#8216;Archived&#8217; is used to identify documents which are no longer current or have been superseded by another agreement. Archived documents are sorted separate from current documents and are collapsed beneath a show/hide link to save screen space. Archiving a document does not delete it from the system. It also does not delete any expressions attached to that document.</p>
<p>&#8216;Document Type&#8217; is another customizable field which allows each library to set their own terminology. The software comes with the following types included.</p>
<p><em>Document Type</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Agreement</li>
<li>Amendment</li>
<li>Countersigned Agreement</li>
<li>Internal Acknowledgement</li>
<li>Order Form</li>
<li>SERU</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>Editing Documents</strong></p>
<p>Once added the documents will display on the Documents tab sorted first by Document Type (agreements sort together, order forms sort together, etc) and then by signature date with most recent first.  Multiple signatures for both licensee and licensor can be added using the &#8216;add signatures&#8217; link. On the right hand column are the links to view, edit, and delete each document. Now that the documents are loaded the next step is to begin adding expressions.  Please note that Expressions are not required. You should however assign an appropriate License Status to the record that indicates it is a document only record.</p>
<p>## <strong>Adding Expressions</strong></p>
<p>The Expressions tab is where the expressions or clauses of the license are entered.  You may enter any expression type that you wish. The software comes with the following expression types already defined but again the field is customizable and allows you to enter the types of your choice.</p>
<p>Expression Type:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Authorized Users</li>
<li>Confidentiality Clause</li>
<li>Course Packs</li>
<li>eReserves</li>
<li>General Notes</li>
<li>Interlibrary Loan</li>
<li>Jurisdiction</li>
<li>Multi-year Term</li>
<li>Post Cancellation Access</li>
<li>Third Party Archiving</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>Adding Expressions</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;add new expression&#8217; link opens the window on the right.  From this window you can add expressions for the documents that have been previously loaded.</p>
<p>&#8216;Document&#8217; is the document name for which you want to add a new expression. The drop-down is pre-populated from the existing document names in the specific license record.  This is a required field.</p>
<p>&#8216;Expression Type&#8217; is the type of expression you wish to add (interlibrary loan terms, course pack rights, etc). This is a required field.</p>
<p>&#8216;Qualifier&#8217; is another customizable field which can be used to qualify particular expressions. For example, a qualifier of <a href="#id41"><span class="problematic" id="id42">*</span></a>Permitted <a href="#id43"><span class="problematic" id="id44">*</span></a>or <a href="#id45"><span class="problematic" id="id46">*</span></a>Prohibited <a href="#id47"><span class="problematic" id="id48">*</span></a>may be appropriate for an Interlibrary Loan expression. You may choose to ignore this field or choose to use it in a different fashion for other expression types.</p>
<p>&#8216;Document Text&#8217; is for the actual text of the license clause. An interlibrary loan expression has been added in the following figure.</p>
<p>## <strong>Adding Display Notes</strong></p>
<p>In this example an Interlibrary Loan expression has been added along with a snippet of the license text and a qualifier of <a href="#id49"><span class="problematic" id="id50">*</span></a>Permitted <a href="#id51"><span class="problematic" id="id52">*</span></a>has been added noting that the item does allow for ILL. The</p>
<p>actual legal text can be quite confusing so the next step is to add a Display Note which can hold an interpretation of the text of the clause that can be used for public display.</p>
<p>## <strong>Adding Display / Internal Notes</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;add/view display notes&#8217; link opens a window which allows you to enter multiple display notes. It also displays the Document Text on that same window so that you can refer back to it while adding the notes.  The sort order of multiple display notes can also be adjusted through this same window. The following figure shows a completed Display Notes window.</p>
<p>There are two types of expression notes in CORAL Licensing; Display Notes and Internal Notes. You can set the note type to either Internal or Display for each expression type on the &#8216;Admin&#8217; page detailed later in this document. The two note types (internal and display) were added so that a distinction could be made between expressions and notes that were intended to be displayed outside the module, for instance in one of the terms tools, and those that were for internal use only.  The  Display Notes which are intended to be shared have additional functionality built in that the Internal Notes lack. In the following figure you will see the completed interlibrary loan expression. In this example the Interlibrary Loan expression type has been set to use Display Notes and as such the expression is presented with an additional checkbox to the left of the Document Text. Internal Notes do not receive this checkbox. When the licensing librarian or other appropriate personnel has finished editing the notes and expression he/she can check this box which indicates that the expression is finished and it makes the expression available through the <a href="#id53"><span class="problematic" id="id54">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id55"><span class="problematic" id="id56">*</span></a>page.  An email is then generated by the system indicating that a new expression has been completed and is ready for display. You can edit the recipients of this email in the <a href="#id57"><span class="problematic" id="id58">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id59"><span class="problematic" id="id60">*</span></a>page.</p>
<p>If you choose not to use the <a href="#id61"><span class="problematic" id="id62">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id63"><span class="problematic" id="id64">*</span></a>page you may turn it off as explained in the technical documentation guide. This will also remove the display note checkbox and email functionality. It will also remove the SFX Links tab which is explained next.</p>
<p>## <strong>Completed Expression</strong></p>
<p>The above figure is the completed expression with document text, qualifier and display notes. Qualifier may not be appropriate for certain expression types. The intended use of the qualifier is to further document permitted/prohibited distinctions such as interlibrary loan, course packs and ereserves. You may continue to add as many expressions as needed for some or all documents.</p>
<p>## <strong>SFX Links</strong></p>
<p>Once the expressions or terms of the license are known, the next question to ask is &#8216;Which journals are covered by these terms?&#8217;. That’s where the SFX Links tab comes into play. Using this tab it is possible to relate a specific license to the covered journals in a specific SFX target or package. In this example the Cambridge University Press Site License Agreement is being associated with the Cambridge Journals Online target in SFX (Cambridge Journals Online is the SFX target public name). This SFX – License connection allows for the delivery of license terms through the SFX menu as detailed in the Terms Tool User Guide.  It is true that not every institution uses SFX. The SFX Links tab could be renamed and/or repurposed for use with other openurl resolvers or journal management systems. This</p>
<p>tab is meant to be used in conjunction with the Terms Tool and can be disabled along with the <a href="#id65"><span class="problematic" id="id66">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id67"><span class="problematic" id="id68">*</span></a>page for those who do not wish to use it.</p>
<p>## <strong>Attachments</strong></p>
<p>For any resource there may be documents in addition to the actual license that are important to retain.  Title lists and email correspondence are two that may be the most common.  The Attachments tab allows you to upload these additional documents to the license record. The above figure shows an email that has been uploaded with the date and a description of the file. In this case the attachment is an email from the publisher detailing additional restrictions on the resource. The date field is not automatically entered by the system so it does not have to be the date the file was loaded into CORAL Licensing. The intention of the date field was to be the date the attached document was received but since the date is manually chosen it can be any date of your choice. The &#8216;view attachment 1&#8217; link will open the uploaded file.</p>
<p># <strong>Licenses in Progress</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="#id69"><span class="problematic" id="id70">*</span></a>Licenses in Progress <a href="#id71"><span class="problematic" id="id72">*</span></a>page will show the licenses that are not yet complete. It is intended to be used by the licensing staff as a queue of outstanding licenses. It has been coded to show licenses of status Awaiting Document or Editing Expressions and will also show new licenses which have not yet been given any status. The hyperlinked License Name will take you into the license record.</p>
<p># <strong>Expression Comparison</strong></p>
<p><a href="#id73"><span class="problematic" id="id74">*</span></a>Expression Comparison <a href="#id75"><span class="problematic" id="id76">*</span></a>allows the user to see all the instances of a specific expression type across all documents in a single screen or view. The &#8216;Limit by Expression Type&#8217; dropdown allows the user to select from among all defined expression types. In the figure above the display notes and document text have been removed for reasons of confidentiality. In place of &lt; Display Notes removed &gt; and &lt; Document Text removed &gt; users would see the actual notes and document text that were entered. This allows licensing or relevant personnel to compare language for each expression type across all documents. It could be an immensely powerful tool when attempting to come up with recommended language during negotiations. The user may also add new display notes, open the license record and open the actual document from this page.</p>
<p><a href="#id77"><span class="problematic" id="id78">*</span></a>Expression Comparison <a href="#id79"><span class="problematic" id="id80">*</span></a>is intended for personnel that need quick access to all expressions in the system. Other library staff however, may only need access to specific types of expressions and this particular page may be information overload. The <a href="#id81"><span class="problematic" id="id82">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id83"><span class="problematic" id="id84">*</span></a>page was developed for these other users.</p>
<p>## <strong>Terms Tool Report</strong></p>
<p>Once again the notes and document text have been removed from the screenshot. <a href="#id85"><span class="problematic" id="id86">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id87"><span class="problematic" id="id88">*</span></a>provides access to only the expressions using display notes and which have been identified as being complete by the licensing librarian using the terms tool checkbox mentioned earlier. As such it will not display unfinished expressions which the licensing librarian may still be working on. Another difference between <a href="#id89"><span class="problematic" id="id90">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id91"><span class="problematic" id="id92">*</span></a>and <a href="#id93"><span class="problematic" id="id94">*</span></a>Expression Comparison <a href="#id95"><span class="problematic" id="id96">*</span></a>is that this page does not offer any links for editing the record. While similar in function to <a href="#id97"><span class="problematic" id="id98">*</span></a>Expression Comparison <a href="#id99"><span class="problematic" id="id100">*</span></a>this page was added in order to serve a user group which does not need the full access provided by the <a href="#id101"><span class="problematic" id="id102">*</span></a>Expression Comparison <a href="#id103"><span class="problematic" id="id104">*</span></a>page.</p>
<p>The main points to remember for this page are that it displays expressions which use display notes but only those that have been approved for display. It is possible to turn off <a href="#id105"><span class="problematic" id="id106">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id107"><span class="problematic" id="id108">*</span></a>and hide it from display if you do not wish to use it. Turning off the <a href="#id109"><span class="problematic" id="id110">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id111"><span class="problematic" id="id112">*</span></a>will also disable the SFX Links tab on the license record as well as the terms tool checkbox used to indicate that a Display Note has been completed and approved for display.  Please see the Terms Tool User Guide for more information on how <a href="#id113"><span class="problematic" id="id114">*</span></a>Terms Tool Report <a href="#id115"><span class="problematic" id="id116">*</span></a>can be used and on how it can be used to push out license terms to other systems.</p>
<p>## <strong>Admin</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="#id117"><span class="problematic" id="id118">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id119"><span class="problematic" id="id120">*</span></a>page is where you will edit Expression Types, Document Types, Signature Types and</p>
<p>License Statuses.  Each of these fields can have as many values as needed so that the system can better</p>
<p>meet local needs.  <a href="#id121"><span class="problematic" id="id122">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id123"><span class="problematic" id="id124">*</span></a>is also where you will edit and manage user permissions. CORAL Licensing has been built with the ability to limit access to select individuals given the confidential nature of license agreements. Users may not access CORAL Licensing until they are first set up with an account by an administrator. The following figure shows the &#8216;add new user&#8217; window available from the <a href="#id125"><span class="problematic" id="id126">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id127"><span class="problematic" id="id128">*</span></a>page.</p>
<p>&#8216;Login ID&#8217; will be the user’s unique ID in your local campus authentication system. See the technical documentation for more details on authentication.</p>
<p>&#8216;Privilege&#8217; is the user’s level of access (i.e. read only, etc).</p>
<p>&#8216;Terms Tool Email&#8217; – Enter email address if you wish the user to receive email notification when the terms tool box is checked for a given expression. Leave this blank for all others.</p>
<p>The values available in the Privilege field deserve further explanation.</p>
<p>Privileges</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Admin users have complete add/edit rights and can remove licenses and associated fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Access to the <a href="#id129"><span class="problematic" id="id130">*</span></a>Admin <a href="#id131"><span class="problematic" id="id132">*</span></a>page, the SFX Links tab on the license record and the terms tool checkbox is restricted to users with Admin privileges.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add/Edit users can add, edit, or remove licenses and associated fields.</li>
<li>View Only users can view all license information and are allowed access to the uploaded documents.</li>
<li>Restricted users can view all license information but are not allowed access to the uploaded documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admin, Add/Edit and View Only are the same privileges used in the other CORAL modules. Restricted is an extra privilege used only in CORAL Licensing in order to restrict access to the actual license agreements that have been uploaded to the system.</p>
