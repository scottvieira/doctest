CORAL Documentation Style Guide
-------------------------------

### About the Style Guide ###

The purpose of the style guide is to help keep the documentation consistent in style while at the same time providing tips for contributing to the CORAL Documentation Project (CDP) and other relevant information.

### Setting Up ###

The CDP is managed in a repo on GitHub found at [https://github.com/Coral-erm 
](https://github.com/Coral-erm  "https://github.com/Coral-erm ").  The project uses the [Sphinx Python Documentation Generator](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/).  The documentation files are edited in a combination of [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), both markup languages supported by GitHub.  In addition, [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is used for hosting the documentation and providing additional documentation conversion and indexing tools.
